        <p1>The front-end of the web is based on three major technologies:<br>
            HTML aka “STRUCTURE”: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure, content and semantics of web pages on the web.</p1>
        <p1><br>CSS aka “PRESENTATION”: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the structure provided by HTML.

        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p1>HTML is used to create electronic documents (pages) that are displayed on the Web.</p1>
        <p1>HTML ensures the proper formatting of content (text, images, video) so that your internet browser can display them as intended.</p1>
        <p1>As a result, HTML is made up of many elements.</p1>
        <p1>These elements are used to hold our content and define how the browser must format and display the content.</p1> 
        <p1>The term markup refers to the set of tags used to structure a page.</p1>
